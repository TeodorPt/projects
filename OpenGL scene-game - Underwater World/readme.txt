Underwater World
-----------------
Project developed by me in C++ for a computer graphics course at university.

The application consists of an underwater scene into which the user can move in all directions with the help of the mouse and WASD keys. 

It is created to exemplify an OpenGL scene, and it provides several nice features such as: caustics effect, simple collision detection, simple fish animation, projected shadows, volumetric shadows, multiple light sources, fog etc.

For the project I have used C++ for development, and Blender+GIMP for objects/textures creation. Altough, the majority of objects (fishes) are not modeled by me, but downloaded from animium.com which provides a lot of fish collections. I do not own the rights for these objects.

Please refer to the project documentation (as it was presented) for detailed explanation of the implementation. Several implementation files are presented here, although the full project is not given (resources and external libraries not attached).
