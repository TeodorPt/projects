The application offers the possibility to view real scenes which were recorded using a cube map
method (360 degrees view in all directions) to be viewed on the phone in an interactive manner. The
application provides the possibility to view the scene by rotating the phone: i.e. the user rotates the
phone to the right, the scene open in the application also rotates to the right, the user rotates the
phone upwards, the scene also rotates upwards etc. This functionality is achievable with the help of
a gyroscope. If the mobile device does not posses such a sensor, the user will be able to rotate the
scene using finger swipes: i.e. manually rotate the scene in a direction by swiping in that direction.

Implemented using OpenGL ES 2.0 on Android. Development environment used was Android Studio.
